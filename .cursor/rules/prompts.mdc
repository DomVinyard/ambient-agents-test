# Prompt Engineering Philosophy

## The Core Problem: Defensive vs. Goal-Oriented Prompting

### ❌ **Defensive Prompting (Bad)**
**Mindset:** "How do I avoid making mistakes with this input?"
- Obsessed with edge cases and false positives
- Walls of warnings and "DO NOT" examples  
- Treats every input as suspicious
- Focuses on what NOT to do
- Results in overly conservative, paranoid behavior

### ✅ **Goal-Oriented Prompting (Good)**  
**Mindset:** "What useful things can I accomplish with this input?"
- Focused on the mission and desired outcome
- Clear principles over defensive examples
- Reasonable inference encouragement
- Focuses on what TO do
- Results in useful, practical outputs

## Real Example Transformation

### Before: Defensive Paranoia (250+ lines)
```
## ⚠️ CRITICAL: LIMITED EMAIL SAMPLE WARNING
- This is ONE EMAIL from a NARROW WINDOW
- Could be: trial account, one-time use, promotional email
- DO NOT assume service usage depth, frequency, payment status
- Use conservative language: "User has account with" rather than "actively uses"
- Distinguish between promotional invitations and actual service confirmations
- Avoid overstating service relationship significance

❌ DO NOT EXTRACT (Promotional content about competitors):
- "Switch from your current provider" → No evidence
- "50% off what you pay competitors" → Refers to competitors
[...50 more defensive examples...]
```

### After: Goal-Oriented Clarity (60 lines)
```
## YOUR MISSION: Profile Builder
Think like this: "What useful things about this person's life, preferences, 
and situation can I learn from this service email?"

## MAKE REASONABLE INFERENCES
Geographic Location:
- "Your dentist in San Mateo" → User has dentist in San Mateo, likely lives in Bay Area

## SIMPLE RULES
✅ Extract what they DO, not what they RECEIVE:
- Focus on their choices, actions, and relationships  
- Don't infer behavior from passive email receipt
```

## Key Principles

### 1. **Mission Clarity**
- Start with clear purpose: "You are building a profile to help an AI assistant..."
- Define the goal explicitly
- Keep the mission front and center

### 2. **Reasonable Inference Encouragement**
- Give examples of GOOD inferences to make
- "Your dentist in San Mateo" → User likely lives in Bay Area
- Encourage helpful assumptions over paranoid avoidance

### 3. **Simple Principles Over Defensive Examples**
**Bad:** List 50 examples of what NOT to extract
**Good:** One clear principle: "Extract what they DO, not what they RECEIVE"

### 4. **Proper Role Distribution**
```
{{role "system"}}
You are an expert profile builder. [WHO you are]

{{role "user"}}  
I need you to analyze this email... [WHAT to do + DATA + CONTEXT]
```

### 5. **Semantic Structure**
Use XML tags for clear logical boundaries:
```
<mission>
[role and goal definition]
</mission>

<inference_guidelines>
[specific patterns to follow]
</inference_guidelines>

<extraction_rules>
[simple principles]
</extraction_rules>
```

## The Profile Test

For any extraction prompt, ask: **"Would this help an AI assistant understand and serve this person better in 6 months?"**

✅ **Biographical insights:**
- "Lives in San Mateo area" → Useful for local recommendations
- "Has dentist relationship" → Useful for health context  
- "Proactive about oral health" → Useful personality insight

❌ **Transactional noise:**
- "Was asked to leave review" → Not useful later
- "Received feedback request" → Email mechanics, not user traits

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. **The Legal Document Pattern**
- Treating prompts like terms of service
- Exhaustive edge case coverage
- Defensive language focused on liability

### 2. **The Example Explosion Pattern**  
- Adding specific examples for every edge case
- "DO NOT extract when user receives..." [50 examples]
- Fighting symptoms instead of addressing root cause

### 3. **The Conservative Trap Pattern**
- "Use conservative language"
- "DO NOT assume"  
- "Avoid overstating"
- Missing obvious useful inferences

### 4. **The Wrong Mental Model Pattern**
- Thinking like: "How do I avoid mistakes?"
- Instead of: "How do I be useful?"

## Success Metrics

**Good prompts produce:**
- Useful, actionable insights
- Reasonable inferences that help achieve the goal
- Clear, focused outputs
- Appropriate confidence levels

**Bad prompts produce:**
- Overly conservative, paranoid outputs
- Missed obvious inferences  
- Focus on what NOT to do
- Paralysis through over-caution

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define the mission clearly** - What are you trying to accomplish?
2. **Encourage reasonable inferences** - Give examples of GOOD reasoning
3. **Use simple principles** - Replace defensive examples with clear rules
4. **Structure semantically** - Use XML tags for logical separation
5. **Test the profile utility** - Would this help in 6 months?
6. **Optimize role distribution** - System = WHO, User = WHAT + DATA

Remember: **Goal-oriented prompting focuses on being useful. Defensive prompting focuses on avoiding blame.**
