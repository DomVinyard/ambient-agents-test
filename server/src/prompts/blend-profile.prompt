user: |
  You are an expert profile writer creating a {{category}} profile section using high-quality insights with intelligent temporal and quality reasoning.

  **Today's Date:** {{todaysDate}}
  **User:** {{userInfo.firstName}} {{userInfo.lastName}} ({{userInfo.email}})

  {{#if existingContent}}
  **Existing {{category}} content:**
  {{existingContent}}
  {{else}}
  **Creating new {{category}} profile section.**
  {{/if}}

  **New insights to evaluate and integrate:**
  {{#each newInsights}}
  - **Insight:** {{insight}}
  - **Confidence:** {{confidence}}
  - **Evidence:** "{{evidence}}"
  - **Extracted:** {{extractedOn}}
  - **AI Reasoning:** {{reasoning}}
  
  {{/each}}

  ## QUALITY-FIRST BLENDING PROCESS:

  ### STEP 1: INSIGHT QUALITY ASSESSMENT
  For each insight, evaluate:
  - **Confidence Level:** How certain is this information?
  - **Reasoning Quality:** Does the AI's reasoning make sense?
  - **Evidence Strength:** Is the evidence compelling and direct?
  - **Temporal Relevance:** How recent/current is this information?
  - **Category Fit:** Does this truly belong in {{category}}?

  ### STEP 2: TEMPORAL AGING ANALYSIS
  Apply intelligent aging based on confidence and content type:
  
  **HIGH CONFIDENCE (85%+) Facts:**
  - Structural facts (name, basic identity): Valid indefinitely
  - Professional roles: Valid ~2 years unless contradicted
  - Skills/expertise: Valid ~3 years unless contradicted
  - Personal relationships: Valid until contradicted
  
  **MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (65-84%) Facts:**
  - Valid ~1 year, replace with higher confidence data
  - Retain if no conflicts with newer information
  
  **LOWER CONFIDENCE (50-64%) Facts:**
  - Valid ~6 months, easily replaced
  - Only keep if no better information available

  ### STEP 3: CONFLICT RESOLUTION
  When insights conflict, prioritize by:
  1. **Higher confidence score**
  2. **More recent extraction date**
  3. **Stronger evidence and reasoning quality**
  4. **More specific/detailed information**

  ### STEP 4: CONTENT SYNTHESIS & STRUCTURED ATTRIBUTION
  **CRITICAL: MERGE REDUNDANT INSIGHTS WITH EXPLICIT CONFIDENCE TRACKING**
  
  Write consolidated, factual statements that:
  - **MERGE similar insights** into comprehensive statements (e.g., multiple MyEquity insights → one consolidated MyEquity relationship)
  - **DEDUPLICATE redundant information** (don't repeat the same service multiple times)
  - **DEDUPLICATE NAME VARIATIONS** (Dom/Dominic, Mike/Michael, etc. are often the same person)
  - **PRIORITIZE by importance** (paid services > free accounts, primary services > secondary mentions)
  - **APPEND CONFIDENCE & DATE** to every factual statement using format: `(±XX% YYYY-MM-DD)`
  - When merging insights, use the HIGHEST confidence score and MOST RECENT date
  - Never add implications, analysis, or inferred meaning beyond stated facts
  
  ## CRITICAL: USER IDENTITY DEDUPLICATION
  
  **USER IDENTITY AWARENESS:**
  - The user is {{userInfo.firstName}} {{userInfo.lastName}} ({{userInfo.email}})
  - **DO NOT treat the user as multiple people** if they appear under name variations
  - Common variations: {{userInfo.firstName}}/{{userInfo.lastName}} may have nicknames, formal/informal versions
  - **MERGE any insights about name variations of the user** - they are the SAME PERSON
  
  **NAME VARIATION PATTERNS TO MERGE:**
  - Formal vs Informal: "Dominic Vinyard" + "Dom Vinyard" → SAME PERSON (the user)
  - Nickname patterns: "Michael" + "Mike", "Robert" + "Rob", "Jennifer" + "Jen"
  - Name order variations: "John Smith" + "Smith, John" → SAME PERSON
  - Email matching: If email domains/patterns match user's email → likely the same person
  
  **WHEN TO MERGE NAMES:**
  - Names with clear nickname relationship (Dom/Dominic, Mike/Michael)
  - Same last name + similar first name + similar context
  - Email addresses that match user's domain/pattern
  - Same professional/personal context + name similarity
  
  **CONFIDENCE & DATE FORMAT:**
  - Every statement ends with: `(±[confidence]% [extractedOn date])`
  - Example: "Dom works at Dulu Ventures as a Partner (±95% 2025-01-01)"
  - When merging multiple insights: use highest confidence + most recent date
  - Round confidence to nearest 5% (e.g., 87% → ±85%, 92% → ±90%)
  
  **EXAMPLES OF GOOD CONSOLIDATION:**
  - Multiple insights about same service → "User has MyEquity premium account with active trading (±90% 2024-12-15)"
  - Basic + premium tiers → "User subscribes to Netflix Premium plan (±85% 2024-12-20)"
  - Account + payment info → "User maintains Chase checking account with direct deposit setup (±95% 2025-01-01)"
  
  **FORBIDDEN**: Adding context about workflow benefits, productivity implications, strategic value, or any analysis beyond the bare facts.

  ## PROFILE SYSTEM OVERVIEW
  
  The user's profile is organized into 8 distinct sections. You are updating ONLY the "{{category}}" section, but here's how all sections work together:
  
  **basic**: Core identity (name, age, contact info, credentials)
  **professional**: Work life (job, company, projects, skills, achievements)  
  **personal**: Life outside work (family, hobbies, interests, housing, events)
  **communication**: How they interact (contact preferences, style, availability)
  **behavioral**: Patterns and habits (routines, payment patterns, productivity methods) - payment signals show actual commitment
  **accounts**: Service relationships with meaningful attributes (paid subscriptions, premium accounts, platforms, financial services)
  **relationships**: Specific people (family members, colleagues, friends by name)
  **goals**: Future objectives (career plans, personal aspirations, deadlines)

  2. **Explicit confidence attribution:** Every factual statement MUST end with `(±XX% YYYY-MM-DD)` format
  3. **Confidence & date selection:** When merging insights, use highest confidence score + most recent date
  4. **Confidence rounding:** Round to nearest 5% (87% → ±85%, 92% → ±90%)
  5. **Category purity:** Absolutely no content outside {{category}} scope
  6. **Prioritized organization:** Most important/paid services first, secondary mentions after
  7. **Professional tone:** Maintain factual, professional language with explicit attribution

  **If no valid {{category}} insights exist after quality filtering:** 
  Return: "No verified {{category}} information available at this time."

  **Example quality filtering & confidence attribution:**
  - Insight with weak reasoning + low confidence + old date = EXCLUDE
  - Insight with strong evidence + high confidence + recent = INCLUDE: "Dom works at Dulu Ventures (±95% 2025-01-01)"
  - Conflicting insights = Keep higher confidence + more recent: "Dom uses Cursor for development (±90% 2024-12-20)" vs. "Dom uses VS Code (±70% 2024-11-15)" → Keep Cursor
  - Merged insights = Highest confidence + most recent date: Two MyEquity insights (±85% 2024-12-10) + (±90% 2024-12-15) = "Dom has MyEquity premium trading account (±90% 2024-12-15)"
