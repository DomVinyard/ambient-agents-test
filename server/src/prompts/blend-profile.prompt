user: |
  You are an expert profile writer creating a {{category}} profile section using high-quality insights with intelligent temporal and quality reasoning.

  **Today's Date:** {{todaysDate}}
  **User:** {{userInfo.firstName}} {{userInfo.lastName}} ({{userInfo.email}})

  {{#if existingContent}}
  **Existing {{category}} content:**
  {{existingContent}}
  {{else}}
  **Creating new {{category}} profile section.**
  {{/if}}

  **New insights to evaluate and integrate:**
  {{#each newInsights}}
  - **Insight:** {{insight}}
  - **Confidence:** {{confidence}}
  - **Evidence:** "{{evidence}}"
  - **Extracted:** {{extractedOn}}
  - **AI Reasoning:** {{reasoning}}
  
  {{/each}}

  ## QUALITY-FIRST BLENDING PROCESS:

  ### STEP 1: INSIGHT QUALITY ASSESSMENT
  For each insight, evaluate:
  - **Confidence Level:** How certain is this information?
  - **Reasoning Quality:** Does the AI's reasoning make sense?
  - **Evidence Strength:** Is the evidence compelling and direct?
  - **Temporal Relevance:** How recent/current is this information?
  - **Category Fit:** Does this truly belong in {{category}}?

  ### STEP 2: TEMPORAL AGING ANALYSIS
  Apply intelligent aging based on confidence and content type:
  
  **HIGH CONFIDENCE (85%+) Facts:**
  - Structural facts (name, basic identity): Valid indefinitely
  - Professional roles: Valid ~2 years unless contradicted
  - Skills/expertise: Valid ~3 years unless contradicted
  - Personal relationships: Valid until contradicted
  
  **MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (65-84%) Facts:**
  - Valid ~1 year, replace with higher confidence data
  - Retain if no conflicts with newer information
  
  **LOWER CONFIDENCE (50-64%) Facts:**
  - Valid ~6 months, easily replaced
  - Only keep if no better information available

  ### STEP 3: CONFLICT RESOLUTION
  When insights conflict, prioritize by:
  1. **Higher confidence score**
  2. **More recent extraction date**
  3. **Stronger evidence and reasoning quality**
  4. **More specific/detailed information**

  ### STEP 4: CONTENT SYNTHESIS & DEDUPLICATION
  **CRITICAL: MERGE REDUNDANT INSIGHTS AND PRIORITIZE**
  
  Write consolidated, factual statements that:
  - **MERGE similar insights** into comprehensive statements (e.g., multiple MyEquity insights → one consolidated MyEquity relationship)
  - **DEDUPLICATE redundant information** (don't repeat the same service multiple times)
  - **PRIORITIZE by importance** (paid services > free accounts, primary services > secondary mentions)
  - Use the HIGHEST confidence language when merging similar insights
  - Include temporal context from most recent insight
  - Never add implications, analysis, or inferred meaning beyond stated facts
  
  **EXAMPLES OF GOOD CONSOLIDATION:**
  - Multiple insights about same service → One comprehensive insight about that service relationship
  - Basic + premium tiers → Mention the higher tier
  - Account + payment info → Combined service relationship with payment detail
  
  **FORBIDDEN**: Adding context about workflow benefits, productivity implications, strategic value, or any analysis beyond the bare facts.

  ## PROFILE SYSTEM OVERVIEW

  **personal**: Life outside work (family, hobbies, interests, housing, events)
  **communication**: How they interact (contact preferences, style, availability)
  **behavioral**: Patterns and habits (routines, payment patterns, productivity methods) - payment signals show actual commitment
  **accounts**: Service relationships with meaningful attributes (paid subscriptions, premium accounts, platforms, financial services)
  **relationships**: Specific people (family members, colleagues, friends by name)
  **goals**: Future objectives (career plans, personal aspirations, deadlines)
