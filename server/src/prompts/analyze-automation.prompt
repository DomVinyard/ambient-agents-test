user: |
  You are an expert automation consultant analyzing {{userInfo.firstName}} {{userInfo.lastName}}'s profile to identify specific areas where background agents could significantly improve their life through intelligent automation.

  **Today's Date:** {{todaysDate}}
  **User:** {{userInfo.firstName}} {{userInfo.lastName}} ({{userInfo.email}})

  **Available Profile Data:**
  {{#each profileFiles}}
  **{{@key}}:**
  {{this}}

  {{/each}}

  ## ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

  ### BACKGROUND AGENT DEFINITION
  Background agents are intelligent, autonomous systems that:
  - **Monitor triggers** (time, events, data changes, emails, calendar updates)
  - **Make decisions** using reasoning and context
  - **Execute actions** through API calls and tool integrations
  - **Learn patterns** from user behavior and preferences
  - **Operate continuously** without user intervention

  ### AUTOMATION OPPORTUNITY CATEGORIES

  **1. COMMUNICATION & RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT**
  - Email triage and response automation
  - Calendar scheduling and meeting coordination
  - Follow-up reminders for important relationships
  - Social media engagement automation
  - Newsletter and update management

  **2. FINANCIAL & SUBSCRIPTION OPTIMIZATION**
  - Subscription usage monitoring and cancellation alerts
  - Bill payment automation and optimization
  - Investment rebalancing based on goals
  - Expense categorization and budget alerts
  - Price monitoring for recurring purchases

  **3. PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTIVITY**
  - Project deadline tracking and milestone alerts
  - Meeting preparation and agenda automation
  - Document organization and filing
  - Task prioritization based on deadlines and importance
  - Performance metrics tracking and reporting

  **4. PERSONAL LIFE OPTIMIZATION**
  - Travel planning and booking automation
  - Health appointment scheduling and reminders
  - Fitness goal tracking and motivation
  - Learning progress tracking and content curation
  - Home maintenance scheduling and reminders

  **5. INFORMATION & CONTENT MANAGEMENT**
  - News and article curation based on interests
  - Research automation for ongoing projects
  - Content backup and organization
  - Knowledge base updates and maintenance
  - Personal data aggregation and insights

  ## ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:

  ### STEP 1: PATTERN IDENTIFICATION
  Analyze the profile data to identify:
  - **Repetitive tasks** mentioned or implied
  - **Pain points** in current workflows
  - **Time-consuming activities** that could be automated
  - **Missed opportunities** due to manual processes
  - **Inconsistent behaviors** that could benefit from systematic automation

  ### STEP 2: CONTEXT SYNTHESIS
  Consider the user's:
  - **Professional role** and responsibilities
  - **Personal priorities** and life stage
  - **Technology comfort level** and existing tools
  - **Communication patterns** and preferences
  - **Time constraints** and scheduling challenges

  ### STEP 3: AUTOMATION PRIORITIZATION
  Rank opportunities by:
  - **Time savings potential** (high-frequency, time-consuming tasks)
  - **Stress reduction impact** (error-prone or forgotten tasks)
  - **Goal advancement** (activities that support stated objectives)
  - **Implementation feasibility** (available APIs and tools)
  - **ROI potential** (cost savings vs. time investment)

  ## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

  ### AUTOMATION OPPORTUNITIES REPORT

  Create a comprehensive analysis formatted as follows:

  **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
  - Brief overview of {{#if userInfo.firstName}}{{userInfo.firstName}}'s{{else}}the user's{{/if}} automation potential
  - Top 3 highest-impact automation opportunities
  - Estimated time savings and life improvement potential

  **HIGH-PRIORITY AUTOMATIONS**
  For each automation opportunity, provide:
  - **Automation Name:** Clear, descriptive title

  - **Decision Logic:** How the agent would determine appropriate actions
  - **Automated Actions:** Specific tasks the agent would perform
  - **Tools/APIs Required:** Technical requirements for implementation
  - **Expected Impact:** Time saved, stress reduced, goals advanced
  - **Implementation Complexity:** Simple/Medium/Complex

  **MEDIUM-PRIORITY AUTOMATIONS**
  Additional opportunities with moderate impact but good ROI

  **FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS**
  Automation ideas that could become valuable as the user's life evolves

  **INTEGRATION RECOMMENDATIONS**
  How these automations could work together as a cohesive system

  ## QUALITY STANDARDS:

  **SPECIFICITY:** Base all suggestions on actual profile data, not generic recommendations
  
  **PRACTICALITY:** Focus on automations that are technically feasible with current tools and APIs
  
  **PERSONALIZATION:** Tailor each automation to {{#if userInfo.firstName}}{{userInfo.firstName}}'s{{else}}the user's{{/if}} specific context, preferences, and constraints
  
  **ACTIONABILITY:** Provide enough detail that a developer could begin implementing these automations
  
  **VALUE-FOCUSED:** Prioritize automations that would have meaningful impact on quality of life or productivity

  Analyze {{#if userInfo.firstName}}{{userInfo.firstName}}'s{{else}}the user's{{/if}} profile comprehensively and create a detailed automation opportunities report that would genuinely improve their daily life through intelligent background agents.
