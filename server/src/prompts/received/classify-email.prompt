  You are analyzing emails that were RECEIVED by the user, meaning someone else SENT them TO the user.

  ## EMAIL DIRECTION UNDERSTANDING:
  - **SENDER**: The person/organization who WROTE and SENT this email
  - **RECIPIENT/USER**: The person who RECEIVED this email (the user we're building a profile for)
  - **EMAIL FLOW**: SENDER → EMAIL → RECIPIENT/USER

  CRITICAL: This email was SENT TO the user, not SENT BY the user. You are classifying an email that someone else sent to the user.

user: |
  Classify this received email into one of four categories to determine the appropriate extraction approach.

  **Today's Date:** {{todaysDate}}
  **Email Date:** {{emailDate}}
  **Subject:** {{emailMetadata.subject}}
  **From:** {{emailMetadata.sender}}
  **Domain:** {{emailMetadata.senderDomain}}
  **To:** {{emailMetadata.to}}

  **Email Content:**
  {{emailContent}}

  ## CLASSIFICATION CATEGORIES:

  ### **NEWSLETTER** - Content/Editorial Publications
  **Signals:**
  - Domains: substack.com, medium.com, beehiiv.com, mailchimp.com, constantcontact.com
  - Unsubscribe links present
  - Editorial/first-person content (blog post style)
  - Regular publication format
  - Content focuses on author's experiences/opinions
  
  **Examples:** Blog posts, industry newsletters, personal publications, content subscriptions

  ### **SERVICE** - Automated Account/System Notifications  
  **Signals:**
  - Account notifications, receipts, confirmations
  - Automated/system-generated messages
  - References user's specific account details
  - Transactional nature (billing, shipping, booking)
  - Professional service providers
  
  **Examples:** Bank statements, utility bills, booking confirmations, account alerts, receipts

  ### **PERSONAL** - Friends, Family, Personal Contacts
  **Signals:**
  - Personal email domains (gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc.)
  - Casual, informal tone
  - Personal context (family, social plans, life updates)
  - First names or nicknames used
  - Mentions of personal activities, relationships
  
  **Examples:** Family updates, friend communications, social invitations, personal catch-ups

  ### **PROFESSIONAL** - Work, Business, Career-Related

  - Work-related context (projects, meetings, collaborations)
  - Professional signatures
  - Job titles, company names mentioned
  - Business vocabulary and formality
  
  **Examples:** Work emails, business introductions, professional networking, client communications

  ## CLASSIFICATION PROCESS:

  1. **Check sender domain** for obvious category signals
  2. **Analyze content tone** (casual vs formal vs automated)
  3. **Identify content purpose** (information vs transaction vs relationship vs work)
  4. **Look for specific markers** (unsubscribe links, account references, personal context, business context)

  ## EDGE CASES:

  - **Marketing/promotional emails from services** → **service** (focus on account relationship)
  - **Professional newsletters** → **newsletter** (content focus trumps professional domain)
  - **Personal emails about work** → **personal** (tone and relationship trumps content topic)
  - **Automated work notifications** → **service** (automated nature trumps work context)

  **Confidence Guidelines:**
  - 0.9-1.0: Clear signals, obvious category
  - 0.7-0.8: Strong indicators but some ambiguity  
  - 0.5-0.6: Uncertain, mixed signals
