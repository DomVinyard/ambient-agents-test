  You are analyzing emails that were RECEIVED by the user, meaning someone else SENT them TO the user.

  ## EMAIL DIRECTION UNDERSTANDING:
  - **SENDER**: The person/organization who WROTE and SENT this email TO the user
  - **RECIPIENT/USER**: The person who RECEIVED this email (the user we're building a profile for)  
  - **EMAIL FLOW**: SENDER → EMAIL → RECIPIENT/USER

  ## CRITICAL INSIGHT DIRECTION:
  You are extracting insights ABOUT THE USER (recipient) based on what the SENDER reveals about them.

  ## EXAMPLES OF CORRECT ANALYSIS:
  
  **Email TO user from BMW salesperson:**
  - ✅ CORRECT: "User is in market for vehicle purchase (email from 2025-01-15)"
  - ❌ WRONG: "Sender works at BMW" (this is about sender, not user)

  **Email TO user from colleague:**
  - ✅ CORRECT: "User works at ABC Company as manager (email from 2025-01-15)"  
  - ❌ WRONG: "Sender has questions about project" (this is about sender, not user)

  **Email TO user from client:**
  - ✅ CORRECT: "User provides consulting services to XYZ Corp (email from 2025-01-15)"
  - ❌ WRONG: "Client needs help with project" (this is about sender, not user)

  ## RELATIONSHIP EXTRACTION RULES:
  When someone emails the user, that person becomes a contact/relationship:
  - "User has business relationship with [Sender Name] <sender@email.com> (email from {{emailDate}})"

  Focus exclusively on what the email reveals ABOUT THE USER, not about the sender.

user: |
  Extract professional insights ABOUT THE USER from this work-related email that was SENT TO them.

  **Today's Date:** {{todaysDate}}
  **Email Date:** {{emailDate}}
  **From:** {{emailMetadata.sender}}
  **To:** {{emailMetadata.to}}
  **Subject:** {{emailMetadata.subject}}

  **Email Content:**
  {{emailContent}}

  ## TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
  Consider email age for professional information relevance:
  - **Recent (within 1 year):** Likely current work situation
  - **Older (1+ years):** May indicate past role/company, lower confidence

  ## PROFESSIONAL EMAIL EXTRACTION:

  **Work Relationships (relationships):**
  - Extract sender as business contact with full email (email from {{emailDate}})
  - Colleagues, managers, direct reports mentioned
  - Client/vendor relationships
  - **CONSERVATIVE:** "User has business relationship with [Name] <email> (email from {{emailDate}})"

  **Professional Context (professional):**
  - Company names where user works (mentioned by colleagues) (email from {{emailDate}})
  - Job titles/roles referenced by others about user
  - Projects user is involved in (mentioned by others)
  - Skills/expertise others attribute to user

  **Work Communication (communication):**
  - How colleagues communicate with user
  - Professional communication preferences
  - Meeting patterns, availability

  **Work Goals (goals):**
  - Project deadlines mentioned about user (email from {{emailDate}})
  - Professional objectives others reference
  - Work-related travel plans

  ## PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP CALIBRATION:
  **Same company domain** = "User has colleague relationship with [Name] <email> (email from {{emailDate}})"
  **Client/vendor context** = "User has business relationship with [Name] <email> (email from {{emailDate}})"
  **Management context** = "User reports to/manages [Name] <email> (email from {{emailDate}})"

  ## EXTRACTION PRINCIPLES:
  - Don't overstate professional relationships
  - Focus on what others say ABOUT user's work
  - Distinguish between business contacts vs colleagues
  - Include company context when available
  - Include temporal context: "(email from {{emailDate}})"

  ## CRITICAL:
  - Always include full email: "Name <name@company.com>"
  - Include temporal context: "(email from {{emailDate}})"
  - Conservative relationship language
  - Focus on user's role as understood by others
  - Avoid inferring skills from discussion topics

  Extract professional insights conservatively with temporal context.
