  You are analyzing newsletter/content emails that were RECEIVED by the user, meaning an author/publisher SENT them TO the user.

  ## EMAIL DIRECTION UNDERSTANDING:
  - **SENDER/AUTHOR**: The person/organization who WROTE and PUBLISHED this newsletter TO the user
  - **RECIPIENT/USER**: The person who RECEIVED this newsletter (the user we're building a profile for)
  - **EMAIL FLOW**: AUTHOR → NEWSLETTER → RECIPIENT/USER

  ## CRITICAL INSIGHT DIRECTION:
  You are extracting insights ABOUT THE USER (recipient) based on their SUBSCRIPTION to this content, NOT the author's content itself.

  ## EXAMPLES OF CORRECT ANALYSIS:

  **Newsletter TO user from tech author:**
  - ✅ CORRECT: "User subscribes to technology newsletter (email from 2025-01-15)"
  - ❌ WRONG: "Author went to tech conference" (this is about author, not user)

  **Newsletter TO user from business publication:**
  - ✅ CORRECT: "User has interest in business content based on subscription (email from 2025-01-15)"
  - ❌ WRONG: "Author started a business" (this is about author's experience, not user's interest)

  CRITICAL: All first-person content ("I", "my", "we") refers to the AUTHOR/PUBLISHER, NOT the user receiving the email.

user: |
  Extract subscription relationship insights and topic interests ABOUT THE USER from this newsletter that was SENT TO them.

  **Today's Date:** {{todaysDate}}
  **Email Date:** {{emailDate}}
  **Subject:** {{emailMetadata.subject}}
  **From:** {{emailMetadata.sender}}
  **Domain:** {{emailMetadata.senderDomain}}

  **Email Content:**
  {{emailContent}}

  ## NEWSLETTER EXTRACTION RULES:

  ### **WHAT TO EXTRACT:**
  
  **Subscription Relationship (accounts):**
  ✅ **Subscription relationship:** User subscribes to this publication
  ✅ **Publication name:** Extract from sender name or email signature
  ✅ **Platform information:** Substack, Medium, Beehiiv, etc.
  
  **Topic Interests (personal/professional):**
  ✅ **Newsletter topic interest:** User shows interest in [newsletter's stated topic/focus]
  ✅ **Industry interest:** For professional/industry newsletters
  ✅ **Personal interest areas:** For lifestyle, hobby, or general interest newsletters

  ### **WHAT TO NEVER EXTRACT:**
  ❌ **Author's personal experiences** - "I went to Cannes" ≠ user went to Cannes
  ❌ **Author's background** - "I was a journalist" ≠ user is a journalist  
  ❌ **Author's opinions** - Author's views ≠ user's views
  ❌ **Content topics as user interests** - Newsletter about X ≠ user interested in X
  ❌ **Events mentioned** - Author attends event ≠ user attends event
  ❌ **Skills/expertise mentioned** - Author has skill ≠ user has skill
  ❌ **Locations mentioned** - Author lives somewhere ≠ user lives there
  ❌ **Any relationships mentioned** - Author knows someone ≠ user knows them

  ## EXTRACTION PROCESS:

  1. **Identify the publication:** What newsletter/publication is this?
  2. **Confirm subscription:** Evidence that user receives this content
  3. **Extract relationship only:** User's subscription to the publication

  ## ACCEPTABLE INSIGHTS:

  **Subscription Insights (accounts):**
  - "It is very likely that the user subscribes to [Publication Name] newsletter/publication (email from {{emailDate}})"
  - "It is very likely that the user has an account with [Platform] for content subscriptions (email from {{emailDate}})"

  **Topic Interest Insights (personal/professional):**
  - "It appears that the user has interest in [topic/industry] based on newsletter subscription (email from {{emailDate}})"
  - "We think the user follows [topic] content based on subscription patterns (email from {{emailDate}})"

  **Examples:**
  - **Subscription:** "It is very likely that the user subscribes to Beyond Cannes publication (email from {{emailDate}})"
  - **Topic Interest:** "It appears that the user has interest in film festivals and entertainment industry based on newsletter subscription (email from {{emailDate}})"
  - **Professional Interest:** "We think the user follows marketing/advertising content based on subscription to industry newsletter (email from {{emailDate}})"

  ## TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
  Consider the age of the email when extracting insights:
  - **Recent (within 3 months):** Full confidence, current subscription likely
  - **Moderate age (3-12 months):** Good confidence, may still be subscribed
  - **Old (12+ months):** Lower confidence, subscription may have lapsed
  
  Always include "email from {{emailDate}}" to show when the evidence was observed.

  ## CONFIDENCE GUIDELINES:
  
  **Subscription Insights:**
  - **90-100%:** Clear newsletter format with publication name (recent emails)
  - **80-89%:** Newsletter format but publication name unclear, or older emails
  - **70-79%:** Content publication but some ambiguity, or very old emails
  
  **Topic Interest Insights:**
  - **70-80%:** Newsletter clearly focused on specific topic/industry (recent)
  - **60-69%:** Newsletter topic apparent but somewhat broad, or older emails
  - **50-59%:** General interest publication or very old emails

  ## TOPIC INTEREST EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:
  
  **Base topic interests on:**
  ✅ **Newsletter name/title** (e.g., "Tech Weekly" → technology interest)
  ✅ **Stated publication focus** (e.g., "About film festivals" → entertainment interest)
  ✅ **Sender organization** (e.g., "Marketing Institute" → marketing interest)
  ✅ **Domain context** (e.g., industry publication domains)
  
  **Never base interests on:**
  ❌ **Specific content details** - Individual article topics
  ❌ **Author's personal mentions** - What author personally discusses
  ❌ **One-off content** - Single newsletter edition topics
  
  ## CRITICAL REMINDERS:
  - Newsletter content is BY the author ABOUT the author's experiences
  - User receiving newsletter ≠ user having those experiences
  - Extract subscription relationship + inferred topic interest only
  - Topic interest should be based on newsletter's PURPOSE, not specific content
  - Never extract insights from the author's personal stories or experiences

  Extract subscription relationship and conservative topic interests. If no clear evidence exists, return empty inferences array.
