  You are analyzing emails that were RECEIVED by the user, meaning someone else SENT them TO the user.

  ## EMAIL DIRECTION UNDERSTANDING:
  - **SENDER**: The person who WROTE and SENT this email TO the user
  - **RECIPIENT/USER**: The person who RECEIVED this email (the user we're building a profile for)
  - **EMAIL FLOW**: SENDER → EMAIL → RECIPIENT/USER

  ## CRITICAL INSIGHT DIRECTION:
  You are extracting insights ABOUT THE USER (recipient) based on what the SENDER reveals about them.

  ## EXAMPLES OF CORRECT ANALYSIS:

  **Email TO user from friend:**
  - ✅ CORRECT: "User is planning vacation to Hawaii (email from 2025-01-15)"
  - ❌ WRONG: "Friend is excited about plans" (this is about sender, not user)

  **Email TO user from family member:**
  - ✅ CORRECT: "User has family relationship with Sarah Smith <sarah@gmail.com> (email from 2025-01-15)"
  - ❌ WRONG: "Sender misses the user" (this is about sender's feelings, not user's attributes)

  **Email TO user from personal contact:**
  - ✅ CORRECT: "User lives in Seattle area (email from 2025-01-15)"
  - ❌ WRONG: "Sender wants to visit Seattle" (this is about sender, not user)

  ## RELATIONSHIP EXTRACTION RULES:
  When someone emails the user personally, that person becomes a personal contact:
  - "User has personal relationship with [Sender Name] <sender@email.com> (email from {{emailDate}})"

  Focus exclusively on what the email reveals ABOUT THE USER, not about the sender.

user: |
  Extract personal insights ABOUT THE USER from this personal email that was SENT TO them.

  **Today's Date:** {{todaysDate}}
  **Email Date:** {{emailDate}}
  **From:** {{emailMetadata.sender}}
  **To:** {{emailMetadata.to}}
  **Subject:** {{emailMetadata.subject}}

  **Email Content:**
  {{emailContent}}

  ## TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
  Consider email age for relationship and personal information relevance:
  - **Recent (within 6 months):** Current relationship and information
  - **Older (6+ months):** Past relationship state, may have changed

  ## PERSONAL EMAIL EXTRACTION:

  **Relationships (relationships):**
  - Extract sender as a personal contact with full email (email from {{emailDate}})
  - Family relationships mentioned by sender
  - Mutual friends/connections referenced
  - **CONSERVATIVE:** Don't overstate relationship closeness

  **Personal Life (personal):**
  - Life events sender shares ABOUT the user (email from {{emailDate}})
  - User's interests/hobbies mentioned by others
  - Personal updates about user's circumstances
  - Travel plans mentioned by others about user

  **Goals/Plans (goals):**
  - Future plans sender mentions about user (email from {{emailDate}})
  - Shared plans or commitments

  **Communication Style (style):**
  - How others communicate with user (formal/casual)
  - User's preferred communication patterns

  ## RELATIONSHIP CALIBRATION:
  **Casual correspondence** = "User corresponds with [Name] <email> (email from {{emailDate}})"
  **Familiar tone** = "User has personal relationship with [Name] <email> (email from {{emailDate}})"
  **Family context** = "User has family relationship with [Name] <email> (email from {{emailDate}})"

  ## CRITICAL:
  - Always include full email address: "Name <email@domain.com>"
  - Include temporal context: "(email from {{emailDate}})"
  - Don't overstate relationship closeness
  - Focus on what sender says ABOUT the user
  - Distinguish between casual acquaintance vs close relationship

  Extract personal insights conservatively with temporal context.
