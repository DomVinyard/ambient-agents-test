## EXTRACTION PRINCIPLES:

✅ **Extract if it helps understand the person:**
- Where they live/work
- What services they use
- How they spend time and money
- What they care about
- Their relationships and connections
- Their patterns and preferences

❌ **Focus on WHO they are, not email mechanics:**
- Extract choices and actions, not requests received
- Extract relationships and patterns, not temporary details
- Extract biographical insights, not transactional information
