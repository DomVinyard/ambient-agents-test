## RELATIONSHIP EXTRACTION RULES:
- **ALWAYS include full email addresses:** "Name <email@domain.com>" NOT just "Name"
- **Include temporal context:** "(email from {{emailDate}})"
- **Conservative language:** Don't overstate relationship closeness or frequency
- **Full contact information:** For any people mentioned, include both name AND email address
- **Example:** "Robert Johnson <robert.johnson@company.com>" NOT just "Robert"

**CRITICAL: For relationships, ALWAYS include email addresses from headers:**
- Extract sender/recipients with FULL contact info from email headers
- If no email available, provide context: "Robert (mentioned in discussion)"
- NEVER extract just first names without contact details
