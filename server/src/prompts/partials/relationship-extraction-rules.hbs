## MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP EXTRACTION:

**WHAT QUALIFIES AS A RELATIONSHIP:**
- **Ongoing personal connections:** Family, friends, colleagues you work WITH
- **Meaningful professional contacts:** People you collaborate with, report to, or work closely with
- **Established relationships:** People who know you personally or professionally (not just your inquiry)

**NOT RELATIONSHIPS - Don't Extract:**
- **Service providers responding to inquiries:** Car salespeople, customer service reps
- **Transactional contacts:** People just fulfilling requests, handling transactions
- **One-off responders:** Random people replying to your outreach
- **Newsletter/marketing senders:** Unless you have a personal connection

**MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP INDICATORS:**
Look for these patterns that show genuine human connections:
- **Ongoing collaboration:** Working together on projects, regular coordination, shared objectives
- **Personal familiarity:** "Great to see you", inside references, casual tone, shared experiences  
- **Thread continuity:** Multiple exchanges showing established communication patterns
- **Mutual knowledge:** References to each other's life, work, or circumstances
- **Social connection language:** Meeting up, catching up, personal updates, relationship maintenance

**FOCUS:** Extract relationships where the person actually knows and interacts with the user as an individual, not just as a customer or inquiry.

**FORMAT FOR ACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS:**
- Include full email: "Sarah Chen <s.chen@company.com>"
- Include temporal context: "(email from {{emailDate}})"  
- Use accurate relationship language: "colleague" vs "friend" vs "family"
