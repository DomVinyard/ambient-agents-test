## EMAIL DIRECTION & INSIGHT FOCUS:

**Email Flow:**
- **SENDER** wrote and sent this email → **USER** received it
- **Your job:** Extract insights about the USER from what the email reveals

**Key Insight Principle:**
Focus on what this email tells us about the USER'S life, not the sender's business details.

**Location Logic:**
- Service provider addresses → User likely lives/works in that area
- "Your dentist in San Mateo" → User has dentist in San Mateo, likely Bay Area resident
- Local service emails → User's geographic context
